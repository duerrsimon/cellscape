	abstract = {Motivation: Illustrative renderings of proteins are useful aids for scientific communication and education. Nevertheless, few software packages exist to automate the generation of these visualizations. Results: We introduce CellScape, a tool designed to generate 2D molecular cartoons from atomic coordinates and combine them into larger cellular scenes. These illustrations can outline protein regions in different levels of detail. Unlike most molecular visualization tools which use raster image formats, these illustrations are represented as vector graphics, making them easily editable and composable with other graphics. Availability and Implementation: CellScape is implemented in Python 3 and freely available at https://github.com/jordisr/cellscape. It can be run as a command-line tool or interactively in a Jupyter notebook.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
