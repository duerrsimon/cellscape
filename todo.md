# more detailed project todo

## composite protein representations
* PDB structure (solved / high-quality model
* ellipse/box low-quality model
* line/spline, no domain information, unstructured/ideal chain?
* place in membrane, orient

## December 2017 Goals
* XML parsing
  * pick out important features, PTM, glycosylation?, phosphorylation?
* structure prediction
* 2d representations from structure
* compositing and placeholders for missing information
* challenge: data structures and simple 2d geometry
